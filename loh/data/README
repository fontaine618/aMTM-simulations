The 'LOH.scm' file is the main script.
Read its starting section for a detail of all the simulation settings.

= How to run the simulations
Type 'make' at the shell prompt to compile and link the C files.

Run the guile script by typing at the shell prompt:

$ guile < LOH.scm > LOH.scm.out 2> LOH.scm.err

This may take a while. Possible error messages are redirected to the '.err'
file, extra output stuff to the '.out' file.

Run the R script 'LOH.R' to load and analyse the produced chain.
